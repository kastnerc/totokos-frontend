## Introduction
The following project was created by the same team that developed Totoko's Temptations last semester, and an earlier project based on the same project. The team is consisted of Caleb Kastner, the project manager, Georgio El-Koury, the driver of the project, and Tristan Bastien, the lead creative developper. The three decided to take the same bakery as Totoko's Temptations and create a backend database just as their teacher had asked. From then on, they added the frontend CSS and Vue the teacher had asked them to add as their final assignement this semester for the class. 

## Frontend Pages
In the following subsections, the screenshots are directly taken from the website's pages, and each have been modeled after the previous Totoko's temptations, with the added functionality of Totoko's Backend. Each of these pages can only be seen by employees of the ficticious _Totoko's Temptations_.

### Ingredient List
This page shows the various ingredients the bakery uses in their produts. You can see the price, expiry date, and stock number on their right.

The order list is very mportant for the employees of the bakery, for it shows the most recent order placed, and the time they must be finished for the client to come and pick it up.

### Search Products By ID
Using the contents of this page, employees have the power to look up any existing order in the database that has that corresponding ID. Very useful, and used to know which products are incluided in the order, which is very useful when bakers must complete an order given to them.

When Totoko's Temptations want to add a new product for a special event, or want to update their confectionnary reservoir, they come to this page to creste them. Or if they so choose to modify a certain product, they can do that too.

### Client's Product List
This is one of the only pages meant for client to see. It shows them which product is available, and for what price. They can even look up a product by its name at the top, if they already know what they want.

### Ingredient-Product Management
This page lets the employees manage which ingredient is associated with which product. They can add and subtract the kinds of ingredients found under the product. A search feature is there, so that's helpful too.
