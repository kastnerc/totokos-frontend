## Introduction
The following project was created by the same team that developed Totoko's Temptations last semester, and an earlier project based on the same project. The team is consisted of Caleb Kastner, the project manager, Georgio El-Koury, the driver of the project, and Tristan Bastien, the lead creative developper. The three decided to take the same bakery as Totoko's Temptations and create a backend database just as their teacher had asked. From then on, they added the frontend CSS and Vue the teacher had asked them to add as their final assignement this semester for the class. 

## Frontend Pages
In the following subsections, the screenshots are directly taken from the website's pages, and each have been modeled after the previous Totoko's temptations, with the added functionality of Totoko's Backend. Each of these pages can only be seen by employees of the ficticious _Totoko's Temptations_.

### Ingredient List
This page shows the various ingredients the bakery uses in their produts. You can see the price, expiry date, and stock number on their right.

### Search Products By ID
Using the contents of this page, employees have the power to look up any existing order in the database that has that corresponding ID. Very useful, and used to know which products are incluided in the order, which is very useful when bakers must complete an order given to them.

### Client's Product List
This is one of the only pages meant for client to see. It shows them which product is available, and for what price. They can even look up a product by its name at the top, if they already know what they want.

This is the only other page a client can access. It exists to give access to user to freshly create their user profiles. The profiles will be used to monitor their orders, location data, and even discounts based on their age.
