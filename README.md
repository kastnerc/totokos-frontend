## Introduction  
The following project was created by the same team that developed _Totoko's Temptations_ last semester, and an earlier project based on the same concept. The team consists of Caleb Kastner, the project manager; Georgio El-Khoury, the driver of the project; and Tristan Bastien, the lead creative developer. The three decided to take the same bakery as _Totoko's Temptations_ and create a backend database just as their teacher had asked. From then on, they added the frontend CSS and Vue that the teacher had asked them to implement as their final assignment this semester for the class.  

## Frontend Pages  
In the following subsections, the screenshots are directly taken from the website's pages, and each has been modeled after the previous _Totoko's Temptations_, with the added functionality of Totoko's Backend. Each of these pages can only be seen by employees of the fictitious _Totoko's Temptations_. They are quite bland to look at apart from the buttons, because they aren't designed to be aesthetically pleasing; they are used day and night by the hardworking fictitious staff of _Totoko's_.  

### Ingredient List  
This page shows the various ingredients the bakery uses in their products. You can see the price, expiry date, and stock number on their right.

### Add/Modify Ingredient  
This page shows the UI an employee uses to add or modify any selected ingredient based on their ID.

### Order List  
The order list is very important for the employees of the bakery, as it shows the most recent order placed and the time they must be finished for the client to come and pick it up.

### Add/Modify Order  
Similarly to the ingredients, this page shows how to modify any selected order or create an order based on how the ID is input.

### Search Products By ID  
Using the contents of this page, employees have the power to look up any existing order in the database that has that corresponding ID. Very useful, and used to know which products are included in the order, which is very helpful when bakers must complete an order given to them.

### Product Category List  
This is the page where all the possible categories a product can be identified under are found.

### Add/Modify Product  
When _Totoko's Temptations_ wants to add a new product for a special event, or wants to update their confectionery reservoir, they come to this page to create them. Or, if they so choose to modify a certain product, they can do that too.

### Search Price History  
This page lets the employee look up the history of a product with its price changes.  
![Screenshot 2024-12-06 142659](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05ed71b9-6037-4c2b-940d-14dc6ee49d7d)  

### Client's Product List  
This is one of the only pages meant for clients to see. It shows them which products are available, and for what price. They can even look up a product by its name at the top if they already know what they want.  
![Screenshot 2024-12-06 142705](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/978e5417-f33c-4365-b756-c742ee137777)  

### Ingredient-Product Management  
This page lets the employees manage which ingredient is associated with which product. They can add and subtract the kinds of ingredients found under the product. A search feature is there, so that's helpful too.

### Add/Modify Product Category  
A very simple page that lets the employee either add, subtract, or modify any category a product can identify itself under.

### Supplier List  
_Totoko's Temptations_ receives their ingredients from multiple sources, and this web page is the ideal place to categorize them.

### Add/Modify Supplier  
From this page, the multiple modifications and additions an employee can make to the supplier list are made.

### User List  
Perhaps the most important page, it shows every single user that has ever used the website since its creation. Very handy to organize people or check their location information for deliveries.  
![Screenshot 2024-12-06 142755](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/646eb4a5-570d-4c1d-a058-d512714a0ef3)  

### User Details  
This is the only other page a client can access. It exists to give clients access to freshly created user profiles. The profiles will be used to monitor their orders, location data, and even discounts based on their age.

## Conclusion  

All in all, the visual part of the website created by the team is complete, and they await their grade from their teacher, expecting their work to be well rewarded. The database is fully functional, and the web pages are completely finished and furnished for commercial use by the fictitious _Totoko's Temptations_.
